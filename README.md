# ith Order Statistic in C++

## 📌 Overview

This C++ program demonstrates how to find the **i-th Order Statistic** — also known as the _k-th smallest element_ — using the **Quickselect algorithm**, a highly efficient selection method derived from Quick Sort:

1. Selects a **pivot** element from the array.
2. Partitions the array so that elements smaller than the pivot go left, and larger elements go right.
